When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when I'm working on multiple devices.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because the remote repository may not contain the best file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  forks -- built in feature to clone someone's else repository, use it while using github.
  clones -- a git command to clone a remote repository, use it to copy from github to local machine
  branches -- a git command to make a diferent version so when you are commiting your original files are not going to be inflicted.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  we can get the diff of the two version of files.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  the easier part is you don't have to learn about git, the downside is collaborating is become much harder with lots of limitation.
