How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced?

	between the two versions of a file, so we can know what have we done wrong
	if the bug is produced on the newer versions of the file.

	our file if the newer file is screwed up or we can use the diff to find 
	possible bug that was created while we were updating our file.
